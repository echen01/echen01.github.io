# Eric Ming Chen
I'm Eric, an undergrad at Cornell University studying Computer
Science! I am interested in 3D computer vision, geometric deep
learning and neural fields. I am advised by [Abe
Davis](http://abedavis.com) and [Noah
Snavely](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/). Last year I was co-president of  [Cornell
University Artificial Intelligence (CUAI)](https://cuai.github.io/).

<!-- # Research -->
<!-- ## Computer Vision -->
<!-- I'm interested in many areas of computer vision, many of which deal -->
<!-- with content creation.  -->

<!-- #### Light Fields -->
<!-- - Although light fields have a long history, I am curious about -->
<!--   finding new applications for them. Because light -->
<!--   fields are fast to render, and are conceptually simple, I think they -->
<!--   have a lot of value.  -->
  
<!-- #### Transforming Faces Through Time -->
<!-- - Have you ever imagined how Charlie Chaplin would have looked like -->
<!--   today, or how a celebrity would have looked in the 1920s? We take a -->
<!--   data driven approach to picture how a person would look in another decade's -->
<!--   style.  -->
<!-- - We introduced a new image dataset consisting of over 25k historical people taken from -->
<!--   the Wikimedia Commons.  -->

<!-- ## Geometric Machine Learning -->
<!-- I am also interested in discovering where geometry and symmetry play -->
<!-- unexpected roles in data.  -->
<!-- #### Riemannian Residual Neural Networks -->
<!-- - We introduce a simple and general way to design residual neural -->
<!--   networks on smooth manifolds.  -->
<!-- -  We apply our model to show improved performance on hyperbolic -->
<!--     graph embedding, and covariance matrix classification.  -->

#### Cornell Rendering Competition Path Tracer
<!-- ![Eevee Render](/assets/eevee_4096spp.jpg) -->
I created a path tracer to render fur for the [Cornell CS
6630](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6630/2022fa/) rendering
competition. I won a copy of Fundamentals of Computer Graphics signed
by Steve Marschner!\

#### Physically Based Smoke Animation
Implemented [Target-Driven Smoke
Animation](https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/danix-lab/cglab/projects/tdsmoke/)
by Fattal and Lischinski. Investigated how to use [divergence-free
neural fields](https://github.com/facebookresearch/neural-conservation-law) to model smoke animation as an optimal transport problem.\
