# Eric Ming Chen
I'm Eric, a junior at Cornell University studying Computer
Science! My interests include 3D computer vision, geometric deep
learning and neural fields. I conduct research with [Hadar
Averbuch-Elor](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~hadarelor/), [Jin
Sun](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jinsun/) and [Noah
Snavely](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/) at Cornell Tech; [Abe
Davis](http://abedavis.com) at Cornell; and
with [CUAI](https://cuai.github.io/).

# Research
## Computer Vision
#### Synthesizing Faces Across Time
- Have you ever imagined how Charlie Chaplin would have looked like
  today, or how a celebrity would have looked in the 1920s? We take a
  data driven approach to picture how a person would look in another decade's
  style. 
- We introduce a new image dataset consisting of over 25k historical people taken from
  the Wikimedia Commons. 

## Geometric Machine Learning
#### Riemannian Residual Neural Networks
- We introduce a simple and general way to design residual neural
  networks on smooth manifolds. 
-  We apply our model to show improved performance on hyperbolic
    graph embedding, and covariance matrix classification.
