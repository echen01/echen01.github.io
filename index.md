# About
I'm Eric, a sophomore at Cornell University studying computer
science! My interests include style-transfer, image-based
rendering and geometric deep learning. I conduct research with [Hadar
Averbuch-Elor](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~hadarelor/), [Jin
Sun](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jinsun/) and [Noah
Snavely](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/) at Cornell Tech; and
with [CUAI](https://cuai.github.io/).

## Research
#### Synthesizing Across Time
- Building a model to capture and manipulate style across 20th century portraits. 

#### Riemannian Residual Neural Networks
- Proposing a generalization of ResNets to Riemannian manifolds.
